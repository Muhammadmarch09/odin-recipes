    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees f. Grease a 9 inch square pan.</li>
      <li>
        Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon into a
        medium bowl. Stir 2 tablespoons white sugar and remaining 2 teaspoons
        cinnamon together in a small bowl.

        Mix brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, and melted butter together in a
        large bowl with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in egg and vanilla.
        Blend in flour mixture until just combined, then stir in apple and
        walnuts. Spread mixture evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle
        cinnamon-sugar mixture over top.
